                    <h3>Project Organisation</h3>
                    <p>
                        For my portfolio website, I made sure to set goals to keep everything on track. I try to balance
                        my work by dividing the time I have onto the group projects and my own portfolio, so that I
                        don't have to rush my portfolio at the end of deadlines. We started the semester off with one
                        less group member as they had never been present, and later another group member decided to drop
                        out. This caused some issues as we had a lot less people compared to the other groups to finish
                        our projects in time. Sometimes it was unclear what everyone inside our group was working on. In
                        the future I think it could be beneficial to regularly hold standups again, just like we had
                        done in semester one. This could help with creating a better idea of where our progress is
                        standing.

                        During the <a href="iterative-design.php#branding">branding project</a> my main task was to
                        create the layout and styling for the brand guide itself. I also created one of the logos, made
                        the stylescape, chose the typography and conducted a survey for the naming of the SoundLab.
                        During the <a href="iterative-design.php#media-campaign">media campaign project</a> I mainly did
                        a competitive analysis and conducted interviews at TQ. For the <a
                            href="lo-development.php#development">development project</a> I was in charge of developing
                        the main home page.

                    <h3>Communication with Stakeholders</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the branding project, my team and I had communicated a lot with the client to nail down their
                        vision and preferences. We also ran surveys to get people's thoughts on the naming and visuals
                        for the sound lab. During the final presentation for the brand guide some of the feedback I
                        recieved from the stakeholder were things like the chosen font being nice for large headers, but
                        not so good for large paragraphs of text. More about the branding project can be found <a
                            href="iterative-design.php#branding">here</a>. For the media campaign some <a
                            href="iterative-design.php#media-campaign">interviews</a> at Fontys TQ
                        had also been
                        organised
                        with the help of the
                        stakeholder. Something that could be improved on is making sure the stakeholders receive the
                        final
                        products that have been created if they want to have them.

                        For my portfolio the stakeholders were the assesors. Since my project X was integrated into my
                        portfolio this was also the case here. During the creation of it I regularly
                        checked in for feedback and various tests. For example the <a
                            href="lo-interactive-media.php#button-test">testing</a> regarding the button controls on the
                        3D-environment of my portfolio. From Paul I also got feedback on how I could best test it. Also
                        the user tests on the guestbook from project X which can be more read about <a
                            href="lo-interactive-media.php#user-test-drawing"></a>here, where I was originally going to
                        make it so comments would have to be approved before they are posted.

                    <p>
                        I conducted research to back up my design choices and project plans. For the branding project
                        various surveys and questionnaires have been done. For example, those for the <a
                            href="lo-iterative-design.php#naming-survey">naming</a> and
                        <a href="lo-iterative-design.php#stylescape">stylescapes</a>. For the OvP project a <a
                            href="lo-iterative-design.php#competitive-analysis">competitive analysis</a> and <a
                            href="lo-iterative-design.php#interviews">interviews</a> have been conducted. For
                        my <a href="lo-interactive-media.php#portfolio">portfolio</a>
                        I have done some scenario tests, and also a literature study. For the 3D-environment of the
                        portfolio I also did some <a href="lo-interactive-media.php#button-test">testing on the button
                            controls</a> about the positioning, styling and
                        functioning.

                    <h3>Reporting</h3>
                    <p>
                        I kept records of my progress and made sure to present my work in a way that made sense for
                        different audiences. My portfolio website is a complete showcase of what I learned and the steps
                        I took. I made improvements based on the portfolio reviews. In the branding project, we put
                        together a brand guide that included all design elements and the identity for the brand, which
                        was then presented to the client. Something that I could improve on is documenting the things I
                        have done earlier right after I am finished with something. During this semester the things that
                        had been done usually started piling up slowly, and this lead to me having a harder time
                        documenting everything. It could also have lead to me forgetting about some of the things that
                        had to still be documented </p>
