                    <h3>Initiative in asking for and reflecting on feedback</h3>
                    <p>
                        I took Initiative in asking for feedback. Some exaples during development where I would
                        sometimes need help doing things like building my project for the first time, and getting
                        feedback on my code and the efficiency of it as a whole. I also asked for feedback on what the
                        best ways to test certain things are. Like during the <a
                            href="lo-iterative-design.php#instagram-posts">media campaign project</a> where we were not
                        sure what products we could best make.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        After this I would fill out the FeedPulse with what was done, the received feedback and what I
                        am going to do following the feedback. Looking back, I need to pay more attention to making sure
                        a FeedPulse is actually created, as I would sometimes forget this. This followed to some things
                        not being documented in it.

                    <h3>Identifying my core values</h3>
                    <p>
                        During this I have grown and learned a lot. I now know that I want to do front-end development,
                        and am a lot more experienced now. During semester 1 I had already used JavaScript and PHP, but
                        did not understand much of what I was doing. I have now gotten a lot better at this. I was also
                        able to learn about 3D-modeling which I enjoyed doing. This is something I could incorporate
                        into future projects.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        In terms of research a learned a lot about how to best conduct them, and the importance. I have
                        gotten a much better idea of what is expected of us for this. However, I still think I can
                        improve a lot on this as I often jump to the creating too quickly instead of testing it first.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, I learned how important feedback is when creating something. For example, my initial
                        structure for my portfolio was very different from what I have now and it has improved a lot.
