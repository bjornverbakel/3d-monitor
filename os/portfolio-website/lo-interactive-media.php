                    <p>
                        During the UX classes I learned about the dimensions of interaction design. I kept these
                        principles in mind during my design and development process to improve the interactivity and
                        usabilty of the current Fontys OvP website.
                        <br><br>
                        Some examples of where these dimensions have been applied are as followed:
                        <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li><span class="bold">Words:</span></li>
                        <p>The text in buttons has been kept clear by labeling them with
                            their exact action, while also being kept short to not overwhelm the user.</p>
                        <li><span class="bold">Visual representations:</span></li>
                        <p>Various icons have been applied to make the functions of the different elements and buttons
                            more clear. For example: carot-icons for dropdowns, three lines for the burger menu icon, a
                            magnifying glass for the search and a flag on the language button.</p>
                        <li><span class="bold">Physical objects or space:</span></li>
                        <p>The website is most likely to be viewed on a desktop, and so the website was designed to be
                            desktop-first</p>
                        <li><span class="bold">Time:</span></li>
                        <p>Various transitions and animations have been applied to give the interactions a smoother
                            feel. This can be seen in elements like the sliding in of menus, hover on header buttons,
                            opening and closing of dropdowns and expanding of search input unpon click.</p>

                    <p>
                        I made a working prototype of the comment system in Figma which you can see in the attached
                        image. I did a small user test and asked Paul
                        for some feedback. The most important thing was about the
                        way the system would function. Originally when you post a comment they would go under review,
                        and then have to accepted or rejected by the admin as seen in the attached database image. He
                        said that
                        this would not be so good
                        because you would not be able to see your comment posted right away, and this takes away some of
                        the interactability. Besides this, it would require constant upkeep to accept or reject
                        comments.
                    <p>
                        <br>
                    <h3 id="user-test-drawing">User test drawing</h3>
                    <p>
                        I did a user test on the version of the comment system where you could also post a drawing as
                        described <a href="lo-iterative-design.php#project-x">here</a>. I did the test with Paul to try
                        and see if he could figure out how to post the drawing properly. It turns out the icon was hard
                        to see due to how small it was. Due to this it was hard to make out what it was supposed to be.
                        Following this I changed the icon into something that was simpler.

                        In Figma, I've added prototyping by incorporating clickable events that lead to different pages,
                        simulating window openings. The same has been done for the main portfolio website that would be
                        displayed inside a simulated Internet Explorer window.

                    <p>
                        I conducted three scenario tests on my Figma portfolio prototype. These scenario tests have been
                        done with Paul, Penny and also a classmate. I added click events to the
                        buttons to make it interactive. I had prepared the following questions:
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>Let's say you want to find out more about me. Where would you navigate to?</li>
                        <li>Can you find what I have done for the development learning outcome?</li>
                        <li>Can you find out how to show the next image in the sequence?</li>
                        <li>You are having trouble seeing the small details in an image, can you enlarge it?</li>
                        <li>How would you return to the learning outcome selection page?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>

                        The navigation was deemed straight forward and completed successfully. One thing that was
                        unclear was
                        the magnifying glass icon to expand an image. This was seen as a search button instead of a
                        button to make the image bigger. I showed some of the other icon options for the image
                        attachments, and have now chosen a different one to use. Another option to expand images that
                        was suggested was to simply have it happen when clicking on the image itself.

                        I did some testing for the button controls on the 3D-environment. I put all the questions
                        inside a <a href="https://forms.gle/2PU1EnZxhKbmjEsTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a>
                        I asked about
                        the position, hover styling and interaction of the buttons. Even though the questions were put
                        into a survey, I still asked them in person so that I could also ask the reasoning for certain
                        answers. I asked various teachers and also a few students.

                        The results were that people prefered to have the button controls in the top left corner because
                        this is where they would look first. Some people prefered to have them in the top right though,
                        because this is where things like maximize/minize buttons would usually be. For the hover effect
                        the inverted colors and border were
                        chosen, as this was the most clearly visible. Someone also suggested having this same inverting
                        of colors, but with the default being white and the hover black. For the small buttons it was
                        chosen to have both
                        on screen at all times instead of swapping them, as this could become confusing.
