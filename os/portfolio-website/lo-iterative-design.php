                    <p>
                        At the beginning of the branding project, each of us in our group created a logo. The first logo
                        was created when we hadn't finalized the chosen name yet, so it still features something else.
                        The inspiration for this mainly came from the logo that Josh had created himself and showed us
                        during the initial briefing.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        All logos were gathered together and presented to the client, asking which direction they
                        preferred for the branding. Each of us had pursued a different style in designing the logos. The
                        feedback
                        we received was that the logo from Lindy was heading in the right direction. Compared to this
                        logo,
                        mine were more minimalistic and sleeker, so we decided to proceed with the chosen logo. However,
                        this experience allowed me to practice with Adobe Illustrator for the first time.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Reflection</h4>
                    <p>
                        Looking back, I think it was good that the logos of all our group members differed so
                        drastically from each other. This allowed us to further narrow down the style and personality
                        the
                        client wanted to have for the brand, as they were still quite unclear in their wishes.
                        Furthermore,
                        only the second logo is in SVG format as I only then started using Adobe Illustrator. For the
                        first
                        one I had used Photoshop, and this is not as good for logos since they will lose quality
                        depending
                        on how big they are resized to.

                        For the naming of the soundlab, the request was to have something in the same vein as Pixel
                        Playground but with its own identity. I asked ChatGPT to generate some names. The prompt for
                        this included the information given during the briefing and the target audience of the sound
                        lab. The following names were the best ones generated:
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>Amplify Avenue</li>
                        <li>Frequency Forge</li>
                        <li>Audio Oasis</li>
                        <li>Soundwave Sanctuary</li>
                        <li>Sonic Spectrum</li>
                        <li>Audio Fusion</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Together with the names from the other group members, the best options were selected and I went
                        around
                        asking people in the OIL which name they preferred for the sound lab. The results were as
                        follows:
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Groove Hub emerged as the winner. However, we also gathered some other feedback. People
                        preferred something simple, perhaps with '-lab' or '-hub', or even just 'SoundLab'. Names like
                        Amplify Avenue and Frequency Forge were considered too complex to pronounce. Additionally, it
                        was noted that 'pulse' and 'wave' essentially meant the same thing. Lastly, while people found
                        Audio Fusion to be unique, they also found it to be bland.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Another survey was conducted later, this time with variations on Groove Hub. The results showed
                        that
                        Groove Room won with just under 60% of the 19 votes.

                    <p>
                        To better establish our branding style, each of us created a stylescape. I started by gathering
                        a
                        lot of inspiration.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        For the stylescape I created, I aimed to make it playful and youthful while still maintaining a
                        professional appearance. I did this because our target audience mainly consists of semester 2
                        and 3
                        media students, and there is professional equipment in the space. I used warmer colors because
                        they
                        evoke a more welcoming feeling.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because it was unclear what style the client wanted for the branding, we collected all our
                        stylescapes
                        and
                        asked to choose a few. The three stylescapes - along with mine - were selected.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The selected stylescapes were later included in a survey, it was decided to exclude the third
                        stylescape
                        because it deviated significantly from the other two. This also helped establish the color
                        palette.
                        The main difference was whether to opt for warmer or cooler colors. The survey results showed
                        that
                        13 out of 19 votes favored the top stylescape because warmer colors were considered more
                        inviting.

                    <p>
                        To determine a font for the branding, I searched on Google Fonts and Adobe Fonts. I was looking
                        for
                        a playful, lively, and bubbly font to match the vibe we were going for. The following fonts
                        emerged
                        from this search.

                    <h4>Reflection</h4>
                    <p>
                        After the final presentation of the brand guide, the feedback we received was that it was a nice
                        font for large headers, but it might become less readable for longer paragraphs of text. A
                        better
                        approach would have been to choose an additional standard font to use for longer paragraphs. In
                        retrospect, I should have also asked for feedback outside of the group which could have helped
                        to identify this problem earlier.

                        In the first version of our brand guide, we didn't have a cohesive theme yet, and the layout on
                        each page varied.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Thus, I redesigned our brand guide. I started by searching for inspiration and found the example
                        seen in the attachment. I was drawn to it because gradients are often used, which aligns with
                        the gradient usage
                        in our branding.

                        To determine if there is a niche or unique selling point that the competitors are not filling
                        and see what they are doing effectively, I conducted a competitive analysis. I did this by
                        analyzing the websites of studies that offer the most similar courses to that of Fontys Pro.

                        information about the study. In terms of videos, they have several interviews with students
                        explaining why they chose the study. Furthermore, there is a video with a tour of the school.

                        is also an informative video, but this needs to be requested and requires filling out a whole

                        lengthy. Additionally, you can request an advisory meeting and brochure.

                        Overall, there are not many studies that specifically market to the target audience of people
                        that are already in the work field, and that want to broaden their knowledge and skills. The
                        benefits that Fontys Pro has to them over a normal study could be used to separate them from the
                        competitors.

                    <p>
                        Some interviews with students at Fontys TQ have been conducted, with the aim of better
                        empathizing with our target audience and understanding their needs. Below is a short summary of
                        the findings from the interviews.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I interviewed 2 individuals who are enrolled in the part-time evening study program. They were a
                        man (23) and a woman (20). They were already working in the field of ICT and wanted to further
                        expand their knowledge in this area. Part-time study was ideal for them because they were
                        already working full-time. One of the individuals had heard about the evening study program
                        through a friend, while the other was hesitant but had heard negative things about another
                        school. One of them found the website difficult to navigate, while the other had no issues with
                        it. The assignments were not related to their work. Many people use LinkedIn there. The reasons
                        for choosing the part-time evening study program were because a full-time study program did not
                        suit them, and they had more time to work full-time. However, it also has its drawbacks because
                        you do not receive student travel products, and you are not entitled to a loan. This is because
                        you already have an income. Overall, when they were looking for a place to study, they mostly
                        just utilized the website and did not pay much mind to advertisements on social media.

                        Nearing the end of our media campaign project we were stuck on what to do, and what products to
                        create. This is because all our research pointed to the fact that when people are looking for a
                        place to study, all they really do is search online for the website. Although they use social
                        media, none of them would use it to search or orient about their study choice.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        To gather some feedback and advice we asked Penny on what the best course of action for us would
                        be at this point. She thought we were overthinking it too much, and that it could be possible we
                        came
                        to this conclusion because of our small sample group. She suggested we should make some things
                        like social media posts or posters regardless, and that it could serve as a starting point for
                        Fontys to research the effectiveness of these mediums.

                    <p>

                        For project X I will be creating a comment system. This will be integrated into my portfolio
                        website through the <a href="guestbook.php">guestbook</a> page. I created some designs for it in
                        Figma. The frames for it can be viewed by downloading the PDF file in the attachment below. In
                        the first frame you see the first version of the main page. I was not happy with how the logout
                        and username section were in the top right as it seemed a bit all over the place. Instead of
                        this I made it so that they are in a bordered section under the header so that the page would
                        flow better.

                        a report feature could be made instead. The admin can also instantly delete comments.

                    <h3>Third version</h3>
                    <p>
                        During the first talk I had with Maikel about what I wanted to do he mentioned something about
                        also being able to draw something instead of it only being text. I liked this idea and designed
                        a prototype of it in Figma. I decided I would not develop it though, as I did not have that much
                        time left and already had sufficient for the development learning outcome. Thus, I decided it
                        would be best to keep it as a Figma prototype. After the <a
                            href="lo-interactive-media.php#user-test-drawing">user test</a> for this I changed to icon
                        for the drawing mode into something simpler that was easier to see.

            <h2>Portfolio</h2>
            <div class="text-section">
                <div>
                    <h3>First version</h3>
                    <p>
                        I started by creating wireframes for my portfolio. I've made one for the desktop and another for
                        the File Explorer application. You can view all the Figma frames by downloading the PDF with the
                        below attachment. After creating these wireframes, I began further refining them to
                        achieve the final look and
                        feel I want for my portfolio.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to style the final content inside a Notepad text file. To make it more interesting and
                        stay within the theme, I wanted to include ASCII art headers. For this, I've created many
                        different versions and combinations to see which one looks the best. Additionally, I've designed
                        various versions of the image attachments with different icons. These will eventually be
                        openable and expandable.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I asked Paul for feedback, and it came out that I should research how ASCII art looked during
                        that time and aim to make it resemble that style more. Additionally, Stan advised me to keep
                        the website's purpose in mind and to start testing quickly. He also recommended to me that I
                        should have the main application open on startup, so that the user doesn't have to dig around to
                        find
                        the content.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Thus, I decided to look for some more inspiration. I found the website <a
                            href="http://henryheffernan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">henryheffernan.com</a>, which I really
                        liked the look of,
                        and it was exactly what I had in mind. Once you start the OS on here, it immediately opens a
                        website in a simulated Internet Explorer tab.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Reflection</h4>
                    <p>
                        In retrospect it would have been better for me to start my research as fast as possible, rather
                        than starting on development. Since I enjoy development the most I often jump onto this too
                        quickly. In this case I had already started on creating the simulated operating system before I
                        had done any testing. However, luckily all the things I had made before my research were things
                        relating to the outside operating system that I would need either way.

                        Rather than styling the content inside of simulated text files, I decided I would instead create
                        a website
                        like in the example mentioned above. I decided to do some research into how these websites
                        looked back then. I used tools like <a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/"
                            target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web Design
                            Museum</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wayback Machine</a> to
                        get a clearer
                        view of this. Additionally, I also looked at a
                        couple of articles and video's that listed some key characteristics of these websites. They
                        often featured things like cluttered or animated background, animated GIFs. Sometimes there
                        would be very big images or icons used as buttons. Another notable characteristic was the way
                        navigation menus were made. I saw a lot of vertical lists, containing a bunch of unstyled
                        hyperlinks.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, I noticed these websites were often very cluttered with content, and there was
                        little white space, which I think was one of the biggest factors that made them so unreadable.
                        The last thing I saw a few times was skeuomorphic design, where the elements are styled to
                        resemble real-world objects or materials using things like detailed backgrounds, textures, and
                        shadows.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Something that has less to do with design, but more with the practices of then were that
                        personal websites would often feature some kind of hit counter and guestbook. In a way these hit
                        counters would function as a primitive version of Google Analytics, and people would be able to
                        leave a comment on the guestbook about what they thought of the website.

                    <h3>Second version</h3>
                    <p>
                        Using the new knowledge and inspiration from my literature study
                        I started
                        designing the second version of my portfolio website. For
                        starters, I made the Internet Explorer window in which I will put the portfolio website. I also
                        made a wireframe where the layout of the pages is made clear.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        In the attached PDF file you can see the designs for the Learning Outcomes page, and that of the
                        individual
                        learning outcomes. I used the characteristics discribed in the literature study
                        like the vertical navigation, unstyled hyperlinks, a hit counter and a guestbook. The last two
                        could be dropped later on depending on how much time I have to finish it, as they were not that
                        necessary. For the fonts I chose
                        a more old-timey font for the headers, and a bitmap font for the regular text. I used large
                        buttons with some
                        animated GIFs on there to fit the theme.

                        started
                        it was concluded that the current image attachment expand icon was unclear. For this reason
                        multiple variations were made with different icons. I asked which one they thought were the most
                        clear in their function. The icon you see on the attachments now were the ones that were chosen.
                        Furhtermore, you can now also expand the image by simply clicking on the image itself.

                        this I first thought of simply downloading a 3D model from the internet that I could use, but
                        later I thought it would be nice and useful to have some knowledge on 3D modeling software.
                        Thus, I found a <a

                        for Blender on YouTube and followed along with it. Once I was finished,
                        I rendered the final picture which can be seen in the attachment.

                        After having become familiar with Blender I started on creating the 3D-model for the monitor I
                        wanted to display the OS on. I used several refference pictures while creating it. Images of the
                        model can be found in the attachments.

                    <h4>UV mapping</h4>
                    <p>
                        I followed the media production class about UV mapping. For this I followed along with what
                        was being done. The assignment was to UV map a Coca Cola can and put the label on it correctly.
                        Besides UV mapping I also learned about the 'Mark sharp' feature, which I did not know about
                        yet. After the UV mapping was done I added a bit of enviroment by adding textured walls and
                        floor, and adding some lighting. I made a final render out of this which can be found in the
                        attachments.

                        I asked Josh for feedback on the model of the PC. Mostly I wanted to know how to best clean up
                        some of the messy geometry. He showed me how to dissolve faces to clean up this geometry. Also,
                        when i was applying some of the textures like the mesh paterns I could not figure out how to
                        best do this so I just added a plane with an image texture on it and applied a shrinkwrap
                        modifier to it. After the lesson about UV mapping it would probbaly have been better to do it
                        this way instead.

                        This was my first time creating something in Blender, and at the start it was quite a challenge
                        with how many functions and shortcuts there are. In the past I have only ever used it to create
                        a quick render of a 3D model that was made using a simpler program. However, after getting the
                        hang of it it actually started to become quite enjoyable. Altough sometimes I do still struggle
                        with getting
                        my geometry set up correctly, I think that after this I have gotten a good
                        grasp of the most important functions in Blender. One thing I couldn't do that was featured in
                        the tutorial was
                        animation, as my FPS would instantly plummet from even doing so much as touching the
                        keyframe dope sheet.

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, I started 3D-modeling long before any of the media production classes for it had
                        started. When the classes for 3D-modeling were announced it was told to <b>not</b> do the donut
                        tutorial, and another one was linked.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During my third portfolio review I got the feedback to also ask the reason for the donut
                        tutorial being discouraged. It turns out most of it was more due to the creator behind it. Also
                        people would often not have a good understanding of all the features because there would be no
                        explanation of why things were being used.
