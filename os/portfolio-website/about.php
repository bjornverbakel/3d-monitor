            <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio. My name is Bjorn Verbakel, I am 17 years old, and currently
                studying ICT & Media Design at Fontys in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. This website functions as a
                portfolio to show my learning outcomes, and what I have created during the second semester.</p>

            <p>Until my fourth year of high school I did not have much experience in programming. This was until
                we had to make a website for a computer science assignment, where I realized that front-end web
                development was something I would like to pursue.</p>

            <p>I am fascinated with 90's style web design of the old internet, which lead me to creating my
                portfolio the way it is. Despite its issues and how much of an eyesore some of them were, I
                think there is something really charming and unique about them that is lost nowadays, especially
                looking at things like the old GeoCities websites. With my portfolio I tried to recreate this
                vibe, while still keeping everything visually clear.</p>
